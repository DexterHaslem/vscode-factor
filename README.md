## Factor listener integration
there is a vscode integration available that is not in the latest release
(0.97 at time of writing). if you are running factor from **sources** / dev builds,
You can do the following to fire up vscode from your scaffold directly:

	USE: editors.visual-studio-code.factor
	edit


All the hard work was already done thanks to the factor/misc/Factor.tmbundle files,
This extension was generated from them. Thanks to whoever made that!
All images and factor material is owned by Factor.
